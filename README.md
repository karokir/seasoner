# seasoner
Your basic seasoning helper - an Android app.

Seasoner is an app for Android that is supposed to help you cook. It provides a list of spices, herbs, sauces and popular mixes. Each seasoning has a short description, 'suggested use' section, and/or some personal tips as how to use it in a creative way. It's simple, but that's how it's meant to be - and hopefully some users will find it helpful.

There are two language versions available: Polish and English (default).

Min SDK version: 16.
Target SDK version: 22.
